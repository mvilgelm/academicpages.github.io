Main projects I am currently contributing to:

* Random Access Protocols for Massive and Reliable Machine-to-Machine Communication (PhD dissertation)

The technological landscape for the firth generation (5G) wireless networks is currently evolving towards three directions: to increase mobile broadband capacity, to accommodate massive Machine-to-Machine (mM2M) devices, and to enable ultra-reliable Machine-to-Machine (uM2M) communication. The first direction has been a conventional way of evolution from 2G to 3G and further to 4G networks. In contrast to that, the latter two directions are truly novel for wireless communication. They are inspired by emerging applications such as smart grids, industrial automation, or vehicular-to-X communication. M2M applications significantly differ from conventional human-to-human applications in their communication patterns and service requirements, creating a unique set of challenges for the full communication stack. Efficiency and performance of medium access control protocols, regulating access to the shared wireless medium, are among these challenges. Since M2M devices communicate infrequency and with low data rate, many wireless M2M technologies rely on random access protocols, either directly for data plane transmissions or for control plane procedures. Existing protocols, primarily based on LTE and its Random Access CHannel (RACH) have been shown to be inefficient in many typical M2M communication scenarios, causing high delays and performance degradation. Hence, there is a need for novel protocols which are scalable with respect to the number of devices, and capable of providing service with low latency and high reliability.
